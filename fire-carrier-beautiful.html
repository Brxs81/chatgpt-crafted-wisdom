    <h1 class="story-title">The Fire Carrier</h1>
    <em>—a poetic story for anyone who feels deeply, burns brightly, and walks between worlds—</em>

    <p>In the beginning, before the world had names,<br>
    there was a child born with <strong>fire in their chest</strong>.</p>

    <p>Not the kind that burns houses—<br>
    but the kind that made stars.</p>

    <p>The elders whispered, “This one is different.”<br>
    The winds leaned closer when they spoke.<br>
    The rivers paused to listen.<br>
    God smiled.</p>

    <p>This child laughed with thunder in their throat<br>
    and dreamed in colors the world hadn’t yet invented.<br>
    They touched joy with bare hands—<br>
    and it danced.</p>

    <p>But one day, the fire grew too wild.<br>
    It surged beyond their ribs and spun them into the sky.<br>
    They flew too fast. Too far.<br>
    The stars became sharp. The light turned blinding.<br>
    Even angels blinked.</p>

    <p>When they fell,<br>
    they fell hard.<br>
    To the ground.<br>
    To the quiet.<br>
    To the shadows under their own skin.</p>

    <hr>

    <p>They thought the fire was gone.</p>

    <blockquote>
      “This is not a punishment.”<br>
      “You were born to carry fire.”<br>
      “But you must learn to walk with it, not run.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>So they began the long walk.</p>

    <p>They learned the rhythm of breath,<br>
    the sacred pause of rest.<br>
    They carved cups from their hands to hold the flame—<br>
    not too tight, not too loose.</p>

    <p>They built altars of stability,<br>
    placed stones of routine,<br>
    sang songs of self-compassion when the fire whispered lies.</p>

    <p>And slowly—<br>
    the fire became a companion.<br>
    Not a master. Not a monster.<br>
    But a <strong>living light</strong>.</p>

    <p>Now, when they speak,<br>
    truth pours like honey and lightning.<br>
    When they move,<br>
    the room softens, aware of the heat they carry.<br>
    And when they cry,<br>
    even God listens more closely.</p>

    <hr>

    <p>People still ask,<br>
    “Is it a curse or a blessing?”</p>

    <blockquote>
      “It’s both. It’s neither.”<br>
      “It’s a fire.<br>
      And I am learning to carry it with grace.”
    </blockquote>
